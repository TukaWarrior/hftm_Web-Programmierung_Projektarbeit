The Alpine Bat's journey began on a fateful day, when a Swiss paraglider named Lucas Winters found himself in treacherous blizzard during a flight through the Swiss alps. A crash left him gravely injured and stranded in a remote mountain cave. There, an encounter with a mystical, winged creature changed his life forever. He arose as the Alpine Bat, Switzerland's guardian, defending its pristine landscapes and mountain domains from threats both natural and supernatural.
