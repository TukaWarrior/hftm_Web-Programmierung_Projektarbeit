Meet Batman, the caped crusader of Gotham who somehow manages to keep his identity secret despite being a billionaire playboy with a bat fetish. By day, he's a philanthropic socialite, and by night, he's a creature of darkness who inexplicably never catches a cold in that skimpy costume. His hobbies include growling, grappling, and never missing an opportunity to dramatically perch on a rooftop.
