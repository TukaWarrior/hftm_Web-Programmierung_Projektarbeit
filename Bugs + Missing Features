Bugs:

contact.php - Contact Form gets submitted at page reload.
Solution: Use a cookie:
<?php
// Check if the form has been submitted
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST" && isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    // Check if a specific cookie is already set
    if (!isset($_COOKIE["form_submitted"])) {
        // Form has not been submitted in this session; process the form
        // ... Your form processing code here ...

        // Set a cookie to indicate that the form has been submitted
        setcookie("form_submitted", "1", time() + 3600, "/");
    }
}
?>

Or redirect to another webpage:
header("Location: success.php"); // Change "success.php" to the appropriate success page
    exit(); // Terminate the current script to prevent further execution


Missing Features:
contact.php - Sumbit Button should be greyed out when not all fields are set
contact.php - Userdfata should be submitted as a .json file, not .txt
Adding a database (but how?!?)
