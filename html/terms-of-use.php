    <div class="terms">

        <h3>Superhero Attire</h3>
        <p>
            While using our services, you are encouraged (but not required) to wear a cape, mask, or other superhero
            attire. Spandex, however, is entirely at your own risk.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Supervillain Rehabilitation</h3>
        <p>
            Our company supports supervillain rehabilitation programs. Please report any urge to turn evil promptly.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Capes</h3>
        <p>
            Capes are fabulous, but wear them with caution.
            In-flight tangling is a genuine occupational hazard.
            Company not responsible for cape-related accidents.
            By using our superhero services, you agree to abide by these terms and join the ranks of the superpowered
            and super-humorous.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Mind Control Waiver</h3>
        <p>
            Please be aware that some superheroes have mind-control abilities,
            but they are trained not to use them to make you do embarrassing things like the chicken dance.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Laundry Duty</h3>
        <p>
            If any superhero costume gets dirty during a mission,
            it's your responsibility to wash, dry, and fold it before their next heroic adventure.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Butt-Kicking and Taking Names</h3>
        <p>
            Please understand that our superheroes may employ witty one-liners when defeating villains.
            They've been practicing these for years and can't help themselves.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Super-Duper Contractual Obligations</h3>
        <p>
            By using our superhero team,
            you agree to bring your own capes and twirl them dramatically when appropriate.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Superpower Sharing Policy</h3>
        <p>
            While our superheroes are at your service,
            they may share their powers with you, but only if they find you sufficiently charming or in dire need.
            Seduction tactics are strictly forbidden!
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Refunds & Returns</h3>
        <p>
            If you are dissatisfied with our superhero services,
            we will gladly refund your payment in the form of invisible,
            intangible coins that can be redeemed in your dreams.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Dimensional Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
            We do not provide services to alternate dimensions.
            You're on your own when it comes to interdimensional travel.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h3>Emergency Cat Rescues</h3>
        <p>
            Superheroes are allowed to interrupt their crime-fighting duties for cat-rescue missions.
            They must return the cat safely to its owner, no matter the circumstances.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h4>
            By using our superhero rental services,
            you agree to these terms.
